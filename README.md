# News Scrapping

This is a collection of simple `python` scripts that uses **`selenium`** and **`beautifulsoap`** to scrape data from `Nepali News Portals`.

> Scrapping from news portals was quite challenging because of the placing of many advertisements, the difference in the interface and the tags of each news portal. One of the main problem I faced was scrapping links for the infinite scroll pages which was sorted by the use selenium.
